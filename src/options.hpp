	 * This option is set by default. You can unset it if you know that this case will never

	 * set --- otherwise, Compare(a,b) answers that question for every pair (a,b). For elements that
	 * compare equally (i.e. Compare(a,b) == Compare(b,a) == false), the hinted version of

	 * down insert and remove operations minimally.

/**
 * @brief Class holding the options for an RBTree
 *
 * This class acts as a container for the options of an RBTree. Note that this class should never
 * (and in fact, cannot be) instantiated. All options are passed as template parameters, and the
 * class itself is in turn passed as template parameter to RBTree and RBTreeNodeBase.
 *
 * Example, setting both the MULTIPLE and ORDER_QUERIES options:
 *
 * @code{.c++}
 * using MyTreeOptions = TreeOptions<TreeFlags::MULTIPLE, TreeFlags::ORDER_QUERIES>;
 * class Node : public RBTreeNodeBase<Node, MyTreeOptions> { â€¦ };
 * using MyTree = RBTree<Node, RBDefaultNodeTraits<MyTree, Node>, MyTreeOptions>;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @tparam Opts List of the options that should be set in the tree.
